Design of Reinforced Concrete, 10th Edition by Jack McCormac and Russell Brown, introduces the fundamentals of reinforced concrete design in a clear and comprehensive manner and grounded in the basic principles of mechanics of solids. Students build on their understanding of basic mechanics to learn new concepts such as compressive stress and strain in concrete, while applying current ACI Code.
